# GitLab Repository Naming Conventions

## Branch Names

### Main Branch
- **`main`**: The primary branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.
  - **Rationale**: Simplifies naming and aligns with modern Git best practices.

### Development Branch
- **`develop`**: Used as an integration branch for features and bug fixes before merging into `main`.
  - **Rationale**: Keeps the main branch stable and ready for release while allowing integration testing and continuous integration (CI) processes on the development branch.

### Feature Branches
- **`feature/description`** (e.g., `feature/login-page`): For developing new features.
  - **Rationale**: Descriptive and provides context about the branch's purpose. Using a prefix like `feature/` makes it easy to identify feature branches.

### Bugfix Branches
- **`bugfix/description`** (e.g., `bugfix/fix-login-error`): For fixing bugs.
  - **Rationale**: Helps differentiate bug fixes from new feature development.

### Hotfix Branches
- **`hotfix/description`** (e.g., `hotfix/critical-security-fix`): For urgent fixes that need to be applied directly to the production branch.
  - **Rationale**: Indicates critical fixes that are prioritized for immediate release.

### Release Branches
- **`release/version`** (e.g., `release/1.0.0`): Prepares for a new production release.
  - **Rationale**: Allows for last-minute testing and minor bug fixes without disrupting ongoing development.

### Experimentation/Spike Branches
- **`experiment/description`** or **`spike/description`**: For experimental features or research.
  - **Rationale**: Clearly indicates branches that are experimental and may not be merged.

## Environment Names

### Production
- **`production`**: The live environment where the application is available to end users.
  - **Rationale**: Clearly defines the environment used by end-users, ensuring critical deployments are managed carefully.

### Staging
- **`staging`**: A mirror of the production environment for final testing before release.
  - **Rationale**: Provides a final check to ensure everything works as expected before reaching end-users.

### Development
- **`development`**: Used by developers to test new features and bug fixes.
  - **Rationale**: Separates ongoing development from production, allowing for safe testing of new changes.

### Testing
- **`testing`** or **`qa`**: For quality assurance and testing purposes.
  - **Rationale**: Dedicated environment for the QA team to run tests without impacting development or production.

### UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- **`uat`**: For stakeholders or end-users to validate the application before production release.
  - **Rationale**: Ensures final acceptance by users or stakeholders, providing a last check before production.

### Sandbox
- **`sandbox`**: For experimenting with new ideas or technologies without impacting other environments.
  - **Rationale**: Provides a safe space for innovation and experimentation.

## Additional Tips

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming conventions to avoid confusion and ensure that team members can easily understand the purpose of each branch and environment.
- **Descriptiveness**: Use clear and descriptive names to convey the purpose of each branch and environment. This helps in identifying the context and goal without ambiguity.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate branches and environments for different purposes (e.g., feature development, bug fixes, testing) to ensure a streamlined workflow and avoid conflicts.

By following these conventions, teams can improve collaboration, maintain clear and organized repositories, and enhance their overall DevOps practices.
